    <h1>The Skiff's Space</h1>


    <h2>Coworking Spaces</h2>

    <h3>The Engine Room: The most popular part of The Skiff</h3>
    <p class="lead">After a few visits you'll always find familiar faces here. Conversation is encouraged. There should always be music on in here. But it should be easy to drown out with headphones. Phone calls with headphones are cool - be conscious of people around you. Events often take place here after 6pm. Whenever that happens you are welcome to join in or continue working upstairs.</p>
    <h3>The Upper Deck: Four Workspaces.</h3>
    <p class="lead">Usually quieter than The Engine Room. These rooms can adapt to your needs. Use as you wish but be extra conscious of the people you're sharing the room with.</p>
    <h2>Meeting Rooms</h2>
    <p class="lead">You can book meeting rooms online or use them for calls at no cost when they're not booked. The only reason we charge for meeting room bookings is to discourage over use. </p>
    <h3>The Bridge</h3>
    <h3>The Cabin</h3>
    <h3>The Ready Room</h3>

    <h2>The Skiff Mates Mess: Your social space</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      You can choose to work in here but you should expect to be disturbed. It's nicest when there are no laptops or phone calls but we don't enforce that.
      We usually have a couple of organised gatherings per week in here: Pastries, Drinks and BYO Lunches. But loads of spontaneous activity too. Listen out for the bells.
      Help yourself to tea and coffee (just refill the pot if you empty it). Use it as you would your own kitchen. But label your things. Please keep it tidy. Mugs in the dishwasher and turn it on when full. Indoor cycle racks for Chief Mates. Outdoor racks for all coming soon.
    </p>
    <h2>Visiting</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Our main enterance is on Blackman Street. Ring the bell and a Skiff Mate will volunteer to welcome you. Leave your name and email address on the Sign Aboard Sheet.

  <h2>Improving our space</h2>
  <p class="lead">We've applied the following principles when considering physical improvements to our space.</p>
  <h3>We prefer ideas and action from members over external consultants</h3>
  <p class="lead">No one understands Skiff Mates better than Skiff Mates. Your experiences working in your space and elsewhere should be the best source of ideas to improve it. 2nd and 3rd Mates who spend time in other spaces are particularly good at coming up with widely appreciated improvements. And when Skiff Mates work together to implement improvements things always turn out better than any of us expect.</p>

  <h3>We prefer long term processes over short term projects.</h3>
  <p class="lead">Are there things we could do once a month, once a week or once a day that would have a cumulative positive affect on our space over the next three to six months?</p>
  <h3>We prefer organic slow-growth over risky high-growth.</h3>
  <p class="lead">I’ll share more on this in a future email. But we’ve always operated with a small annual surplus and never taken on external debt beyond £20,000. Long story short… we’re unlikely to raise tens of thousands of pounds to invest in space improvements.</p>

  <h3>We prefer supporting ideas after decisions have been made</h3>
  <p class="lead">The hardest part of making an idea happen is dealing with the decisions that go with it. “Paint the walls” is a hard idea to make happen. “Paint The Engine Room pink” is easier. But if you said: “Buy three cans of this pink paint [B&Q link] and these brushes [Amazon link] so we can paint the south wall of The Engine Room pink on the 26th August” it’s highly likely to happen - even if you can’t make it on the 26th.</p>

  <p class="lead">
    The Skiff started in a 500 sq ft office on Cheltenham Place. In 2010 we moved to Gloucester Street and then knocked through to Gloucester Road in 2012. We moved into our current, 5,000 sq ft, space at 30 Cheapside in 2016.</p>
  <p class="lead">
    Too many offices feel sterile, stuffy or a little too stylish. They strive to be perfect, professional or plush but fail to reflect the people who work there. The Skiff's space is The Skiff's members space. All members can play a part in making the space feel like an office of their own.</p>
<p>If you want to turn a blank wall into an art exhibition and your fellow members don’t object you are welcome to do it. If you want to change the layout of the tables and everyone still has a place to work please give it a try. Something missing that you think should exist in the space? Make a case for one to be purchased on the group mailing list.</p>
