      The Skiff started in a 500 sq ft office on Cheltenham Place. In 2010 we moved to Gloucester Street and then knocked through to Gloucester Road in 2012. We moved into our current space at 30 Cheapside in 2016. Too many offices feel sterile, stuffy or a little too stylish. They strive to be perfect, professional or plush but fail to reflect the people who work their. The Skiff's Space is The Skiff's members space. All members can play a part in making the space feel like an office of their own.</p>
